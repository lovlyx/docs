## Getting Started

To start using the GameBoost Seller API, you'll need to obtain an API token. This can be done from your GameBoost account in the [Seller API Settings](https://gameboost.com/dashboard/settings/partner-api).

Once you have your API token, make sure to safely store it. You won't be able to see it again.
